### Model is a LSTM model consisting 128, 32, 32, 16, and 16 LSTM layers with Dropout layers of 0.2 after each.
### This is followed by a single Dense 1 layer.

## **TO RUN**
To run LSTM.py simply click run in proper IDE
LSTM.py should run 1000 epochs with a patience of 100 (for non-improvement) and display results.
Next run test_script.py
Results should be displayed

## **ALTERNATIVELY**

Use the Model that has already been included by opening test_script.py and running it
Results should be displayed.
